# Trolley Simulator
This is a simulation of the public transportation system with trolleys. It consists of lines and stops, which the trolleys can traverse.
This simulation is event driven - this system helps make the simulation flow independently, yet sequentially. The code is documented well
enough to get all the details about the simulation from it, and a simple example input file is provided. The simulation has wide logging capabilities
to ensure insight. Have fun!
