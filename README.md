# Trolley Simulator
This is a simulation of the public transportation system with trolleys. It consists of lines and stops, which the trolleys can traverse.
This simmulation is event driven and this system helps make the simulation flow independently, yet sequentially. The code is documented well
enough to get all the details about the simulation from it, and a simple example input file is provided. The simulation has wide logging capabilities
to ensure insight. Have fun!
